# Response to SweepGA Integration Issue

Thank you for the detailed issue report! I've thoroughly investigated and resolved the hanging issues you encountered. Here's what I've implemented:

## ✅ Issue Fixed

The FFI hanging problem has been addressed with a multi-layered solution that provides reliable alignment functionality.

## 🚀 New APIs Available

### 1. Intermediate Pipeline API (Recommended)
```rust
use fastga_rs::intermediate::AlignmentPipeline;

let pipeline = AlignmentPipeline::new(config)
    .with_progress(|stage, msg| {
        eprintln!("[FastGA] {}: {}", stage, msg);
    });

// Full pipeline with progress reporting
let paf_output = pipeline.run_full_pipeline(queries, targets)?;
```

### 2. Timeout Support (As Requested)
```rust
use fastga_rs::timeout::TimeoutAligner;
use std::time::Duration;

let aligner = TimeoutAligner::new(config)
    .with_timeout(Duration::from_secs(30))  // Prevents hanging
    .with_progress(|stage, msg| {
        eprintln!("Stage: {} - {}", stage, msg);
    });

let alignments = aligner.align_files(queries, targets)?;
```

### 3. Step-by-Step Debugging (As Requested)
```rust
// Expose intermediate steps for debugging
pipeline.validate_inputs(query, target)?;     // Check files exist
let query_db = pipeline.prepare_database(query)?;  // Convert to GDB
let target_db = pipeline.prepare_database(target)?;
pipeline.create_index(&query_db)?;            // Build k-mer index
pipeline.create_index(&target_db)?;
let result = pipeline.align_databases(&query_db, &target_db)?;  // Align
```

## 🔧 Root Cause & Solution

**Root Cause**: The FFI calls to `fatogdb_main()` were hanging because these C functions expected stdin/stdout to be available and had initialization requirements not met when called directly via FFI.

**Solution**:
1. Built proper subprocess-based fallback (`simple_runner`)
2. Added intermediate pipeline that uses utilities correctly
3. Implemented timeout mechanism to prevent indefinite hanging
4. Added comprehensive progress reporting

## ✅ Tested and Working

```bash
# Run the working tests
cargo test test_intermediate_pipeline -- --nocapture
cargo test test_timeout_aligner -- --nocapture
```

Both tests pass successfully. The pipeline correctly:
- Validates input files
- Converts FASTA to GDB format
- Creates indices (when needed)
- Runs alignment with timeout protection

## 📝 Updated Integration Code for SweepGA

```rust
// sweepga/src/fastga_integration.rs
use fastga_rs::intermediate::AlignmentPipeline;
use fastga_rs::Config;

pub fn run_fastga_alignment(
    queries: &Path,
    targets: &Path,
    threads: usize,
) -> Result<Vec<Alignment>> {
    let config = Config::builder()
        .num_threads(threads)
        .min_alignment_length(100)
        .build();

    // Use the reliable pipeline approach
    let pipeline = AlignmentPipeline::new(config)
        .with_progress(|stage, msg| {
            log::debug!("FastGA: {} - {}", stage, msg);
        });

    match pipeline.run_full_pipeline(queries, targets) {
        Ok(paf) => {
            fastga_rs::Alignments::from_paf(&paf)
                .map(|a| a.alignments)
                .map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!("PAF parse error: {}", e))
        }
        Err(e) => {
            // Fallback to simple runner if needed
            log::warn!("Pipeline failed: {}, trying fallback", e);
            let paf = fastga_rs::simple_runner::run_fastga_simple(
                queries, targets, threads, 100, None
            )?;
            fastga_rs::Alignments::from_paf(&paf)
                .map(|a| a.alignments)
                .map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!("PAF parse error: {}", e))
        }
    }
}
```

## 📦 Latest Commit

Use commit: `81fe1d5` (just pushed)

```toml
[dependencies]
fastga-rs = { git = "https://github.com/pangenome/fastga-rs.git", rev = "81fe1d5" }
```

## 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **No More Hanging**: Timeout protection ensures alignment never blocks indefinitely
2. **Progress Visibility**: See exactly what stage failed if issues occur
3. **Reliable Fallback**: Process-based execution when FFI has issues
4. **Validated Pipeline**: Each step is tested independently
5. **Better Error Messages**: Clear indication of what went wrong

## 📊 Performance Notes

- The intermediate pipeline adds minimal overhead
- Process-based fallback is slightly slower than direct FFI but much more reliable
- Timeout default is 30s but can be configured
- Progress callbacks have negligible performance impact

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. Very short sequences (<30bp) may cause FastGA to fail
2. Direct FFI still experimental - use pipeline or simple_runner
3. Memory usage scales with genome size (as expected)

## 📧 Contact
